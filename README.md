Stopwatch project is the application which displays a timer displayed at the top, along with three buttons - start, stop, and reset. Clicking the START button will begin the timer. The STOP button will pause the timer using a JavaScript method called SetInterval, which can be cleared using clearInterval. The RESET button will reset the timer to zero. If you click STOP and then START again, the timer will continue from the previously elapsed time.

The application is done with the help of html,css and js.The html code is present in index.html,css code is present in style.css and the js code is present in the script.js.
